* Standalone CPU load checker

* Show total cpu load by seconds

  $cpu

  then, it shows

  <Current Frequency>, <Total>, <User>, <Nice>, <System>,


* Show total cpu load with processes's load

  $cpu <PID1> <PID2> ... <PIDn>

  then, it shows

  <Current Frequency>, <Total>, <User>, <Nice>, <System>,   <PID1 Total>, <PID1 User>, <PID1 System>,  <PID2 Total>, ...
  

* Control "cpu0" clock (by scaling_governor)

  - Set "ondemand"

    $cpu -

  - Set "performance"

    $cpu +


* Show top 5  (as an ad-hoc feature)

  $cpu ...

  "..." is a actural string. Then high-loaded processes will be shown by each second.


* Search PID by process' name (as an ad-hoc feature)

  $cpu <keyword>
